From the reviews: {\textquotedbl}Volume 1 covers a basic course in real analysis of one variable and Fourier series. It is well-illustrated, well-motivated and very well-provided with a multitude of unusually useful and accessible exercises. (...) There are three aspects of Courant and John in which it outshines (some) contemporaries: (i) the extensive historical references, (ii) the chapter on numerical methods, and (iii) the two chapters on physics and geometry. The exercises in Courant and John are put together purposefully, and either look numerically interesting, or are intuitively significant, or lead to applications. It is the best text known to the reviewer for anyone trying to make an analysis course less abstract. (...){\textquotedbl} The Mathematical Gazette (75.1991.471).},
